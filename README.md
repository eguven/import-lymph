# `import lymph`
> An introduction to [lymph](http://lymph.io), a framework for Python services

Hi and thanks for being here. I'd like to introduce you to lymph and Python
services. This introduction is very much example-driven. But fear not, you can
excercise all examples within a vagrant box.

The box provisions with all tooling and code ready for your perusal. It has
both [Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) and
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) running inside. Services and lymph's
tooling can be explored within pre-configured tmux sessions.

The only prerequisits are
[vagrant](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/index.html) and
[ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html) on your host
machine.

Getting hands-on is a matter of running:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mamachanko/import-lymph.git
cd import-lymph
vagrant up && vagrant ssh
```

You will be prompted for your root password half-way through `vagrant up`
because we use NFS to share files. If on Ubuntu(or else) you may have to
specifically install packages to support NFS.

Once inside the box, the `motd` contains more information. You can directly
follow all the examples shown in this introduction.

_Let's start then!_

## Stop trying to glue your services together

_Lymph_ is a framework for writing services in Python. With lymph you can write
services with almost no boilerplate and easily run, test and configure them.
But let's introduce ourselves first.

We're [Delivery Hero](http://deliveryhero.com), a holding of online
food-ordering services. We're located in Berlin. We operate in 34 countries
and growing.

Let me explain the concept of online food-ordering to those who're unfamiliar
with it. However, I seriously doubt this is news to anyone. The concept is
simple:

* get hungry
* go online
* search for restaurants
* compile your order
* pay online
* wait for delivery

Basically, it's e-commerce with very grumpy customers and an emphasis on fast
fulfillment.

How's this introduction structured? Let's briefly go over the topics:

1. We're going to explain where we're coming from and why we have given birth to a(nother) framework
1. We'll look at code as fast possible
1. We'll run services and progressively add new services to explore forms of communication and the tooling of lymph
1. We'll give you a brief overview of further features and talk about how lymph does things under the hood
1. We'll touch on similar technology and see how it relates to lymph (Nameko in particular)
1. We'll talk future plans for lymph and its ecosystem
1. That's it :)

Before we go ahead, here's a little disclaimer. For the sake of this
introduction, we assume that you're familiar with the concept of services. We
assume you're familiar with monoliths. We assume that you are familiar with
when and why to use either and even more so when not. We will not discuss the
differences between the two. We won't talk about how services might save your
development teams or your business. Neither will we talk about sophisticated
networking topologies, Docker, "microservices", ...

But what we're going to talk about is lymph. By the end of the talk you should
understand what lymph can and cannot do and why that's cool. If we achieved
that we'd consider ourselves succesful.

### Why write a framework?

Our initial situation was the classic one. We had a massive Django monolith.
We weren't moving fast at all. We've had trouble finding rhythm for a growing
number of teams and developers. Teams were blocked by other teams. The code
base was a big bowl of legacy spaghetti. We've had issues scaling.

Basically, what comes to mind is the textbook situation: "my monolith hurts, i
want services". The idea of a service-oriented architecture became increasingly
reasonable and attractive to us.

Another aspect is our heterogenic product landscape. While most countries'
websites work the same("order food online") they all differ one way or another.
Modularity, extensibility, reuseability, scaleability... are key for us.

Still, the obvious question is: _"why write another framework?"_. The answer is
almost as obvious. At that time there was nothing that fits our needs. We wanted
to work with services but we wanted some very specific things:

* We are mainly Python-powered and we wanted to continue rolling with it.
  Language-agnosticity is great, but not really important for us(yet).
* Running and testing services should be easy.
* Developers shouldn't have to worry about registering and discovering services.
* You don't have to serialize data for sending it over the wire. Neither do you
  want to manually deserialize it.
* Requesting remote services should be almost like in-process calls.
* Developers shouldn't have to deal with event loops nor know about any
  transport mechanism.
* Configuring services should be straightforward and flexible.
* Scaling should be easy, but transparent to clients.
* Services should speak HTTP.
* We don't want boilerplate if it can be avoided.

To sum things up, we wanted as little in the way as possible between
developers and functionality they want to serve.

You might say _"hey, use [nameko](https://nameko.readthedocs.org)"_. But nameko
has not come to our attention until few months ago. Neither was it mature
enough to be adopted way back then. Later we're going to talk technologies
similar to nameko and lymph.

Taking all these things into consideration, rolling our own thing was actually
reasonable. And to not suspend any further, say hello to
[lymph](http://lymph.io). Hopefully, you're itching to see what a service looks
like in lymph. If you know nameko you won't be surprised though.

We'll break the ice by running and playing around with services. We'll slowly
progress through lymph's features, service by service. This is a good time to
boot the vagrant box.

### Hands-on

#### The Greeting service

[This](https://github.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/blob/master/services/greeting.py)
is what a simple greeting service looks like in lymph. Its interface is one RPC
method called `greet` which takes a name, prints it, emits an event(containing
the name in the body) and returns a greeting for the given name.

```python
import lymph


class Greeting(lymph.Interface):

    @lymph.rpc()
    def greet(self, name):
        print('Saying hi to %s' % name)
        self.emit('greeted', {'name': name})
        return u'Hi, %s!' % name
```

All we need to do to make things happen is to inherit from `lymph.Interface`
and decorate RPC methods with `@lymph.rpc()`. Lastly, we've got the interface's
`emit()` function to our disposal which dispatches events in the event system.

Let's jump on the shell and play with it.

```bash
» mux start greeting
```

What you see here is a tmux session with two panes. On the right-hand side you
see the greeting service being run with lymph's `instance` command. On the
left-hand side you see a plain shell on which we'll explore lymph's tooling.

Every time you want to run an instance of a servcie you need to point lymph to
its configuration. The configuration tells lymph about the interface's name and
where it can import it from. Since lymph imports the interface, its modulea
needs to be on the `PYTHONPATH`. We can make this happen with `export
PYTHONPATH=services` in our example. But worry not, the tmuxinator sessions
take care of it for you. Our service's configuration looks like
[this](https://github.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/blob/master/conf/greeting.yml):

```yaml
interfaces:
    Greeting:
        class: greeting:Greeting
```

The `lymph instance` command receives the path to this file.

One of the first things we considered when building lymph was the tooling. We
think we managed to get some very nice tooling built around it to make
development of services easier.

So what tooling is available? `lymph list` will tell us.

```bash
» lymph list
node       Run a node service that manages a group of processes on the same machine.
shell      Open an interactive Python shell locally or remotely.
help       Display help information about lymph.
instance   Run a single service instance (one process).
list       List available commands.
inspect    Describes the RPC interface of a service
request    Send a request message to some service and output the reply.
discover   Show available services.
subscribe  Prints events to stdout.
tail       Stream the logs of one or more services.
emit       Manually emits an event.
```

You see there's plenty of commands available to interact with services. Worry
not, we'll explore them one by one.

To begin with let's assert that an instance of the echo service is running.
We'll use lymph's `discover` command.

```bash
» lymph discover
Greeting [1]
```

As you can see, one instance is running indeed (`Greeting [1]`). But what did
just happen?  When the service started in the right-hand pane it registered
itself with Zookeeper by providing its name and address. When we ran the
dicovery command found that entry. If we stopped the service, it'd
unregistered itself and the discovery command would say that no instances are
running.

Let's pretend we don't know what the greeting service has to offer. We'd like
to find out though:
 
```bash
» lymph inspect Greeting
RPC interface of Greeting

rpc Greeting.greet(name)

rpc lymph.get_metrics()

rpc lymph.inspect()
         Returns a description of all available rpc methods of this service

rpc lymph.ping(payload)

rpc lymph.status()
```

We see that the interface of the greeting service is composed of inherited
methods(from `lymph.Interface`) and our `greet` method. Let's excercise the
`greet` method. We'll use lymph's `request` command. Therefore, we have to
provide the service name, the name of the method and the body of the request as
JSON. What we expect to see is the echo service to return the text as is, but
it should also print it and emit an event.

```bash
» lymph request Greeting.greet '{"name": "Joe"}'
u'Hi, Joe!'
```

The response to the RPC request is `'Hi, Joe!'`. It's as expected and the
service printed the name. But what exactly did just happen? When we issued the
request lymph did the following:

1. looked up the address of the greeting service in Zookeeper
1. serialized the request body with MessagePack
1. sent it over the wire via zeromq
1. the service received the request
1. the service deserialized the request using MessagePack
1. the service performed the heavy computation to produce the desired greeting for Joe
1. an event is being emitted to the event system about which we will find out more with the next service
1. the response was once again serialized(MessagePack) and sent back(ZeroMQ) to the requestee
1. the requestee(our shell client) deseria... and printed

<img alt="greeting" align="center" src="https://rawgit.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/master/images/greeting.png" width="100%">

Whoi! That's a lot. This is where lymph lives up to this introduction's claim.
This is all the glue that lymph is.

Here's the screencast:
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/9vnx72zknelhvc676in7d7uuv"><img alt="asciicast" align="center" src="https://asciinema.org/a/9vnx72zknelhvc676in7d7uuv.png" width="100%"></a>

Our single service is rather boring though. It's also pretty lonely. Nobody
listens to its events. Here comes a listener.

#### The Listen service

The [listen
service](https://github.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/blob/master/services/listen.py)
listens to greeting's events Again, it's a lymph service(we inherit from
`lymph.Interface`). However, there's nothing but one method which is subscribed
to `greeted` events. It simply prints the greeted name contained in the event's
body. Everytime an event of this type occurs exactly one instance of the
listen service will consume it.

```python
import lymph


class Listen(lymph.Interface):

    @lymph.event('greeted')
    def on_greeted(self, event):
        print('Somebody greeted %s' % event['name'])
```

Let's excercise our services combination. This time round, though, we'll run
two instances of the greeting service and one instance of the listen service.

The [listen service's
configuration](https://github.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/blob/master/conf/listen.yml)
is no different from the one before.

```bash
» mux start greeting-listen
```

Again, we see a tmux session. On the right you find two instances of the
greeting service followed by an instance of the listen service.

We should find them registered correctly.

```bash
» lymph discover
Greeting [2]
Listen [1]
```

And, indeed, they list correctly. Remember, this comes from Zookeeper.

Let's emit a `greeted` event in the event system to assert whether the listen
service listens to it. We'll use lymph's `emit` command. We're expecting the
listen service to print the name field from the event body.

```
» lymph emit greeted '{"name": "Joe"}'
```

Nice. That worked. The listen service printed as expected. But what did just
happen exactly? Our shell client serialized the event body using MessagePack and
published it to RabbitMQ with the `greeted` event type. Then it returned. The
listen service on the other hand is subscribed to these events in RabbitMQ.
Once we published it consumed the event, deserialized it and processed it. As
an outcome it printed.

If there were several instances of the listen service only one of them would've
consumed the event. That's singlecast. Lymph can also broadcast to all
instances of a service.

Keep in mind that if another service would've subscribed to this event as well,
one instance of it would've also consumed the event. Yet, only one instance of
each subscribed service. That's the pub-sub communication pattern. Also, we
could emit any random event and our shell client would return, e.g. `lymph emit
hi '{}'`. Publishers don't know about subcribers or if they exist at all.

Returning to our example, when we do RPC requests we expect the greeting
instances to respond in round-robin fashion while the listen instance should
rect to all occuring events.

```bash
» lymph request Greeting.greet '{"name": "Joe"}'
u'Hi, Joe!'
```
(do this repeatedly, until both greeting instances have responded)

As you see, our expectations are met. Lymph takes care of picking one of the
instances from Zookeeper. That's client-side load-balancing.

<img alt="greeting-listen" align="center" src="https://rawgit.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/master/images/greeting-listen.png" width="100%">

If we were to run several instances of the listen services, each event would be
consumed by exactly one instance. However, lymph allows to broadcast events as
mentioned above.

Here's the screencast:
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/23575"><img alt="asciicast" align="center" src="https://asciinema.org/a/23575.png" width="100%"></a>

Finally, since it's 2015, no talk would be complete without talking about HTTP.
Let's add a web service to the mix. Let's say we wanted to expose the greeting
functionality via an HTTP API. Lymph has a class for that.

#### The Web service

[This](https://github.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/blob/master/services/web.py)
is the Web service. It subclasses lymph's `WebServiceInterface`. In this case
we're not exposing RPC methods, emitting not listening to events. However, we
configure a Werkzeug URL map as a class attribute. We've added one endpoint and
a handler for it: `/greet`. The handler receives a Werkzeug request object.

Webservice are very powerful as they help to expose our services capabilities
to the world in the internet's language: HTTP.

```python
from lymph.web.interfaces import WebServiceInterface
from werkzeug.routing import Map, Rule
from werkzeug.wrappers import Response


class Web(WebServiceInterface):

    url_map = Map([
        Rule('/greet', endpoint='greet'),
    ])

    def greet(self, request):
        """
        handles:
            /greet?name=<name>
        """
        name = request.args['name']
        print('About to greet %s' % name)
        greeting = self.proxy('Greeting').greet(name=name)
        return Response(greeting)
```

The greet handler expects a name to be present in the query string. It calls
the greeting service via the `self.proxy`, returns the result in the
response and it prints.

Mind, that we're not validating the request method nor anything else.

Run it or it didn't happen, they say. We'll bring up an instance of each of
services now.

Once more, the [web service's
configuration](https://github.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/blob/master/conf/web.yml)
is no different from the ones we looked at before.

```bash
» mux start all
```

On the right you can see an instance of every service: web, greeting and
listen.

Once again, they should have registered correctly:

```bash
» lymph discover
Web [1]
Greeting [1]
Listen [1]
```

Let's hit our web service and see how the request penetrates our service
landscape. We should see all service print something. The web service is
listening at the default port 4080. We're using `httpie` to excercise the
request:

```
» http localhost:4080/greet?name=Joe
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 8
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 08 Jul 2015 20:51:30 GMT
X-Trace-Id: 3adc102707f745239efb2837c1877f59

Hi, Joe!

```

The response looks good and all services should have performed accordingly.

<img alt="node" align="center" src="https://rawgit.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/master/images/all.png" width="100%">

Here's the screencast:
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/23578"><img alt="asciicast" align="center" src="https://asciinema.org/a/23578.png" width="100%"></a>

#### Lymph's development server

Yet, when developing locally you seldomly want to run all of your services
within different shells or tmux panes. Lymph has its own development server
which wraps around any number of services with any number of instances.
Therefore, we'll have to configure which services to run and with how many
instances in [`.lymph.yml`](.lymph.yml):

```yaml
instances:
    Web:
        command: lymph instance --config=conf/web.yml
        numprocesses: 2

    Greeting:
        command: lymph instance --config=conf/greeting.yml
        numprocesses: 3

    Listen:
        command: lymph instance --config=conf/listen.yml
        numprocesses: 4


sockets:
    Web:
        port: 4080
```

(Since we run several instances of our web service we have to configure a
shared sockets for it.)

Mind that in our case `command` specifies lymph instances but this could also
be any other service you need, e.g. Redis.

Let's bring them all up.

```bash
» mux start all
```

Once more, we find ourselves inside a tmux session with `lymph node` running in
the top-right pane. Below that you see `lymph tail` running which allows us to
follow the logs of any number of services. But first, let's check how many
instances are running:

```bash
» lymph discover
Web [2]
Greeting [3]
Listen [4]
```

That's a good number. Once we feed a request into the cluster we should see
print statements and logs appearing.

```bash
» http localhost:4080/greet?name=Joe
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 8
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 08 Jul 2015 20:51:30 GMT
X-Trace-Id: 3adc102707f745239efb2837c1877f59

Hi, Joe!

```

Within the `node` pane we should the see following haiku-esque sequence of print
statements:

```bash
» lymph node
About to greet Joe
Saying hi to Joe
Somebody greeted Joe
```

<img alt="node" align="center" src="https://rawgit.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/master/images/node.png" width="100%">

Within the `tail` pane though, there's a lot going on. You would find an even
bigger mess the more services and instances you run and the more intricated
your patterns of communication become. Sometimes you wonder "where did my
request go?". Lymph helps you though with `trace_id`s. Every request that
appears in our cluster which doesn't have a _trace id_ assigned yet gets one.
Trace ids get fowarded with every RPC and event.

We are able to corellate all log statements in our cluster to that one HTTP
request. In fact the web service returns the the trace id in the `X-Trace-Id`
header. If you check the logs within the tail pane you should see that all logs
can be correlated with that trace id. And indeed we see the same `trace_id`
across our service instances for every incoming request. Here are the logs:

```
[tcp://127.0.0.1:37589][a4673a399d] [INFO] 2015-07-18 11:17:34,646 [INFO] lymph.web.interfaces: GET /greet - trace_id="04dc39a5a1a44c809ec31a2dfde62f71"

```

We've covered most of the available tooling. You should have a pretty good idea
how to interact with your services now.

Here's the screencast:
<a href="https://asciinema.org/a/23579"><img alt="asciicast" align="center" src="https://asciinema.org/a/23579.png" width="100%"></a>

There's one command we haven't tried yet. That's `lymph subscribe`. It is being
left to the reader as an excercise.

### More built-in features

#### Testing

Let's talk about features which go beyond CLI tooling. Testing services is
crucial for development. Have a look at our services
[`tests`](https://github.com/mamachanko/import-lymph/blob/master/tests.py) to
get an idea of lymph testing utilities. The tests showcase how you would tests
these three varieties of services. You can run the tests with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=services nosetests --with-lymph
```

#### Configuration

Earlier, we have mentioned that ease of configuration was a concern for lymph.
There's an API to deal configuration files. Its thin abstraction over the
actual YAML files but gives you the freedom to instantiate classes right from
the config. This gives you the freedom to configure services with a minial
amount of code. Custom configuration can be processed by overriding lymph
interface's `apply_config(self, config)` hook.

Let's say your `Service` is supposed have a `cache_client`. This client should
be fully configurable and the ramifications of instantiating should not be the
service's concern. We could configure our service to run with a redis like so:

(for this we assume that both `redis` and `memcache` are set in your
`/etc/hosts` to point to the respective IPs. that'd be `127.0.0.1` in most
cases. but `redis` and `memcache` read nicer.)

```yaml
# conf/service_redis.yaml
interfaces:
    Service:
        class: service:Service

        cache_client:
            class: redis.client:StrictRedis
            host: redis
            port: 6379
            db: 1
```

As you can see the config contains all information we need to instantiate the
redis client's class. Let's make use of the config API then and configure
our service in the `apply_config(self, config)` hook:

```python
# service/service.py
import lymph 


class Service(lymph.Interface):

    def apply_config(self, config):
        super(Service, self).apply_config(config)
        self.cache_client = config.get_instance('cache_client')
```

As you see it takes only one line to configure the service. Running it is a matter
of pointing to the desired config file:

```bash
» lymph instance --config=conf/service_redis.yml
```

We could have other instances running on top of memcache though. Like so:

```yaml
interfaces:
    Service:
        class: service:Service

        cache_client:
            class: pymemcache.client:Client
            server:
              - memcache
              - 11211
```

Again, you run it by pointing it to the desired config file:

```bash
» lymph instance --config=conf/service_memcache.yml
```

You can also share instance of such classes over instances of your services.
All service instances [share the same zookeeper client
instance](https://github.com/deliveryhero/lymph/blob/master/conf/sample-node.yml#L9)
by default. Or you read from [environment
variables](http://lymph.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html#environment-variables).

#### Up and down

You may want to set the stage when bringing up your service. Performing
clean-up tasks when shutting down is just as likely. Therefore you may override
the `on_start(self)` and `on_stop(self)` hooks.  For the `Service` from the
previous section we could do:

```python
    def on_start(self):
        super(Service, self).on_start()
        print('started with client: %s' % self.cache_client)

    def on_stop(self):
        print('stopping...')
        super(Service, self).on_stop()
```

#### Futures

Classic RPC calls block until the response is received. A deferred RPC call
mechanism is implemented in case you wish to consume the RPC response later, or
simply ignore it. Lymph's RPC implementation allows to defer calls:

```python
proxy('Greeting').greet.defer(name=u'John')  # non-blocking

#### Metrics

Standard process metrics are being collected out of the box and exposed via an
internal API. It is possible to collect and expose custom metrics.

#### Plugins

Lymph has a plugin system which allows you to register code for certain hooks,
e.g. `on_error`, `on_http_request`, `on_interface_installation` etc. A [New
Relic](https://github.com/deliveryhero/lymph/blob/master/lymph/plugins/newrelic.py)
and a
[Sentry](https://github.com/deliveryhero/lymph/blob/master/lymph/plugins/sentry.py)
plugin are shipped as built-ins. You can also register your own hooks.

#### CLI extensions

Lastly, CLIs are pluggable as well. Have a look at [`lymph
top`](https://github.com/mouadino/lymph-top) as an example.

### Under the hood

How does lymph do things under the hood? It isn't black magic. This section
actually turned out to be much shorter than expected.

Lymph depends on Zookeeper for service registry. Zookeeper is a distributed
key-value store. Once a service instance is being started it registers itself
with Zookeper providing its address and name.  Once it's being stopped it
unregisters itself. When you send a request to another service, lymph gets all
instances' addresses and routes the request. That means, lymph does client-side
load balancing. Request
[round-robin](https://github.com/deliveryhero/lymph/blob/master/lymph/core/rpc.py#L140-155)
over the instances of a service. The request itself is being serialized with
[MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) and send over the wire using
[ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/).

Lymph's pub-sub event system is powered by
[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).  That means any valid topic exchange
routing key is valid lymph event type. Lymph also allows to broadcast and delay
events.

Every service instance is a single Python process which handles requests and
events via of greenlets. Lymph uses [gevent](http://www.gevent.org/) for this.

Lymph uses [werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/) to handle everything WSGI and
HTTP.

### Related frameworks and tech

Right now it seems as if both [nameko](https://nameko.readthedocs.org/) and
lymph are the only Python service frameworks that exist. This is true for the
level of integration and self-contained tooling at least. Obviously, they are
different frameworks by different authors having been implemented
independently. Nonetheless, they do share some striking characteritics. To us,
these similarities validate our assumptions. It is worth mentioning that nameko
doesn't do service registry explicitly though. Nameko achieves this by using
RabbitMQ for both events and RPC. It'd be tedious to compare them both in
detail but it is highly recommended to have a look at nameko as well.

Most other similar technologies aren't either Python-specific or provide
specific solutions for RPC for instance like [zerorpc](http://www.zerorpc.io/).

Things that are worth mentioning though are
[cocaine](https://cocaine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/),
[spread](http://www.spread.org/index.html),
[circuits](http://circuitsframework.com/), ...

### Future

We intend to grow the little ecosystem around lymph. While lymph will stay the
core framework, we're already in the process of developing complementary
libraries for writing special-purpose services, e.g. for storage and business
process. Naturally, we'll open-source them once they have matured well enough.

Lastly, we'd like to mention
[distconfig](https://github.com/deliveryhero/distconfig) which is a Python
library for managing shared state, i.e. configuration, feature switches etc.
Distconfig is intended to complement lymph.
